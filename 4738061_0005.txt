This reei of microfiim contains materiai
witich itas paper color changes, stainS, or
illustratione, (some of which may appear on
. peges mixed with printed text). in order to

ensure that aii text arrd illustrations are ,

ieqibie, exposure settinqs must be changed.
therefore, witer] text and illustrations exist
in a sinqie image or when materiei
bacquounds differ, such frames may need
to be exposed twice.

The first exposure refiects the cernere
operator’s best effort to capture the majority
of tite text; tite second exposure refiects the

camera operator’s best effort to capture
iliustrative materiai or the remaining text. it

is hopeci that this practice witi resuit in a
microtiirri product thet fuiiy serves the needs

ot most researchers.
